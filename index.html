          <p>
            H-IQ 17 is a simple haiku-writing program/AI. Her name stands for <b>'Human-Imitation Quasipoet v.17'</b>. She was created with about 17 cups of <b>coffee</b>, there are 17 <b>syllables</b> in most haikus, and her creator was part of the 17th <b>class</b> at <b class='gschool'>Galvanize</b>.<br><br>
            I've always enjoyed writing poetry, and while I am certainly <b>not a master</b>, I've put a lot of thought into why <b>we enjoy a good poem</b>. On one hand, we assign meaning to words, even if they would seem <b>out of place</b> in a literal sense. I made this program in the hopes that some of us will <b>rethink</b> why we write poetry, and <b>improve</b> our product because of it.<br><br>H-IQ 17 might not always pass the <b>Turing test</b>, but she'll certainly pass the test to win your heart. You're also welcome to <b>plagiarize</b> these poems - if you tell someone about H-IQ 17 in return so she doesn't get lonely. <b>Enjoy!</b>

          <h4 class='panel-title'>Why Haiku?</h4>
          <p>
            Haiku has existed as a Japanese art form since the <b>7th century</b>, and has many different forms in Japanese; however, in Western culture these poems are typically expressed in a <b>5-7-5</b> syllable count, as you'll find them here.<br><br>
            English is a <b>complex</b> language in the sense that you can have things spelled the same way, but sound completely different. Take, for instance, the words <b>cough</b>, <b>through</b>, <b>tough</b>, and <b>bough</b>. They're spelled the same, but they're all pronounced differently.<br><br>Haiku is simpler in the sense that it <b>doesn't rhyme</b>; however, it can be difficult to count syllables, since haiku is always written in a <b>5-7-5</b> <em>on</em>; an <em>on</em> is essentially a phonetic sound in the Japanese language. While Japanese words can carry more meaning, it provides a <b>unique challenge</b> to create whole concepts in Western haiku.

            H-IQ 17 would like to join forces with an AI capable of <b>conceptualizing</b> topics and suggesting new words; she would then take these words and organize them by <b>syllable</b>, give them <b>grammar</b>, and then write more <b>beautiful poems</b> with the words.<br><br>If you have any suggestions or questions for H-IQ 17 or the website, feel free to <b>contact</b> her human servant!
